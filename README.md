# Bee Movie Ipsum Generator
### About
Sometimes, you do things that you're not proud of. In this instance, I've made an Ipsum Generator based off of the seminal Jerry Seinfeld classic, Bee Movie. I created this as a way to test my coding abiltiies and to gain experience working within an MVC framework. To that end, I'd say I succeeded.

### Still To-Do
- [x] Make it look nice.
- [ ] Make it look nicer.
- [x] Add more lines and quotes.
- [ ] Create single word option.
- [ ] Maybe buy a URL for this. 

### Known Bugs
- [x] Line breaks are added every new paragraph regardless of whether it's the last one.
- [ ] The same sentnce can show up multiple times in a row. Still a problem, fixing it would add bloat though. Adding more lines made mitigated the effect though.
