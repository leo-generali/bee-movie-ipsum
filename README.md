# Bee Movie Ipsum Generator
### About
Sometimes, you do things that you're not proud of. In this instance, I've made an Ipsum Generator based off of the seminal Jerry Seinfeld classic, Bee Movie. I created this as a way to test my coding abiltiies and to gain experience working within an MVC framework. To that end, I'd say I succeeded.
